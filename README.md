# Pratilipi Recommendations

### Problem Statement

Based on the given user data we need to give suggestions to a user which Pratilipi should they read next.

Based on problem Statement i used both collabrative filtering and content bsed in our case category based filtering(since there is no content available but category)

collabrative filtering is like giving suggestions to a user based on similar kind of users(which share similar behavior )

content-based filtering involves giving Recommendations based on users previous reading.
